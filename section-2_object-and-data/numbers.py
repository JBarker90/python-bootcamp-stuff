# You can do simple math with Python

# Addition:
x = 2
y = 1
print("x + y is: ",x + y)

# Subtraction:
x = 2
y = 1
print("x - y is: ",x - y)

# Multiplication:
x = 2
y = 2
print("x * y is: ",x * y)

# Division:
x = 3
y = 2
print("x / y is: ",x / y)

# Modulo:
# The term modulo is simply the remainder

x = 7
y = 4
print("x % y is: ",x % y)
